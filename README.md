# PyHx OS
A terminal-based pseudo-operating system written entirely in Python. PyHx emulates a minimal OS-like environment with a custom shell, multi-user support, a sandboxed application format, and an intuitive, human-readable command language for core tasks.

## üî• Why PyHx?
PyHx is built with **usability first**. It's designed to be a fun, hackable, and educational project for both beginners and power users.

* **Human-Readable Commands**: No need to memorize cryptic commands for file management. Instead of `ls` or `mkdir`, you use `look` and `make dir`.
* **Sandboxed App System**: A complete `.pyhx` application system lets you package, install, and run custom terminal apps in a safe, isolated environment.
* **Multi-User Support**: A complete user system with `admin` and `user` roles, password hashing, and privileged commands.
* **Built-in Tools**: Comes with a rich set of commands for system info, user management, network tools, and more.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.9 or higher.
* `pip` (Python's package installer).
* `git` for cloning the repository.

### Installation & First Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/HarisGO/PyHx.git](https://github.com/HarisGO/PyHx.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd PyHx
    ```
    
3.  **Run PyHx:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

On the very first run, PyHx automatically creates the necessary `config` and `packages` folders inside your project directory. The default administrator account `root` is created with the password `root`. It is highly recommended to log in and immediately change this password using the `changepass` command.

## üíª How to Use PyHx
After starting `python main.py`, you'll be greeted by the user selection menu. Choose your user and enter your password to log in.

The prompt shows your current username, hostname, and directory, ready for your commands:
`root@pyhx-host:PyHx$`

To see a full list of commands and what they do, just type `help`.

## üì¶ The `.pyhx` App System
PyHx features a custom application format, `.pyhx`, for running sandboxed programs. A `.pyhx` file is simply a ZIP archive containing the app's code, with a `main.py` file at its root.

This allows you to create and share your own terminal applications that can be safely run within PyHx.

### Example: Creating and Running a "Hello World" App

1.  **Create your app's folder and file:**
    ```
    my-app/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
    ```

2.  **Write your Python code** in `my-app/main.py`:
    ```python
    # my-app/main.py
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    print(f"Hello, {name}, from inside a PyHx app!")
    ```

3.  **Launch PyHx** and use the `convert` command to package your app. This creates `my-app.pyhx` in the `packages/` staging folder.
    ```
    PyHx$ convert -pyhx my-app-dir
    ```

4.  **Install the app** to make it runnable. This moves it to the `packages/installed/` directory.
    ```
    install my-app.pyhx
    ```

5.  **Run your app!**
    ```
    run my-app.pyhx
    ```
    The OS will launch your app in a safe, temporary environment and clean up automatically when it's done.
